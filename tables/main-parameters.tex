    \toprule
    \textbf{Parameter}
     & \textbf{Description}
    \\ \midrule
    $\kappa$
     & Security parameter; length of the random oracle output.
    \\ \midrule
    $m$
     & The number of parallel chains ($m = \Theta(\log^2 \kappa)$).
    \\ \midrule
    \phaseLength
     & The length of a phase in number of rounds, it consists of 3 different stages: (i) view convergence of length \phaseViewLength rounds; (ii) output generation of length \phaseOutputLength rounds; and (iii) reference convergence of length \phaseRefLength rounds.
    \\ \midrule
    \densityParam
     & The density parameter that asks for at least $\densityParam \cdot \phaseRefLength$ blocks in any consecutive rounds of length at least \phaseRefLength in the output generation and reference convergence stage.
    \\ \midrule
    $T$
     & The target to successful solve a PoW.
    \\ \midrule
    $h_r$
     & Number of RO queries made by honest parties at round $r$.
    \\ \midrule
    $t_r$
     & Number of RO queries made by corrupted parties at round $r$.
    \\ \midrule
    $\delta$
     & Advantage of honest parties $(t \le (1 - \delta) h)$.
    \\ \midrule
    $f$
     & Block generation rate; the probability at least one honest party succeeds in finding a PoW in a round.
    \\ \midrule
    $\epsilon$
     & Quality of concentration of random variables in typical executions, cf.~\cref{def:typical-execution}.
