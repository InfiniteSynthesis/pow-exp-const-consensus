    \\ \midrule
    \round
     & Party \party's local time.
    \\ \midrule
    \phase
     & Party \party's local phase.
    \\ \midrule
    \parallelChainsLocal
     & Party \party's local parallel chain.
    \\ \midrule
    \denseChains
     & Party \party's local recorded dense chains.
    \\ \midrule
    \chainBuffer
     & The buffer that stores all incoming new parallel-chains and their associated dense chains.
    \\ \midrule
    \inputBlockBuffer
     & The buffer that stores all incoming new input-blocks.
    \\ \midrule
    \val
     & Party \party's suggestion for protocol output.
    \\ \midrule
    \lock
     & Whether \party should adopt the output from chain-king.
    \\ \midrule
    \decide
     & Whether \party has decided to output \val.
    \\ \midrule
    \exit
     & Whether \party should stop mining. $\exit = \infty$ if \party have not yet decided; $\exit = 1$ implies that \party will terminate mining in the next iteration and \party stops mining when $\exit = 0$.
